# TODO:

* Move fasta into a sequence.py file. Have a sequence class. It will know how to
get columns out and stuff



# DONE:

* Maybe should have an implicit universal configuration. Just keep it in
configuration? Stop trying to be so object-oriented?

* Get rid of partition sets. Just add to a list. When the first scheme is
  created we make it and lock it.
