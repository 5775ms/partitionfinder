PartitionFinder test suite:
===========================

The test suite consits of two perl scrips and a series of data
directories which contain the individual test.

I) The perl script "single-pf-test.pl" performs a single test.
It requires the following parameters:
1) The path to the PartitionFinderProtein.py or PartitionFinder.py file.
2) The path to the data directory, which must contain a cfg and a data file.
3) An indicative string that must occurr in the log file for the test to pass.
   E.g. "Processing complete" if the process should run without errors.
   E.g. "'WAG+I+G+I' is not a valid model for phylogeny program phyml." if there is a problem with model.
4) Optional. Parameters to PartitionFinder. E.g. "--raxml".


II) The perl scipt run-tests.pl calls single-pf-test.pl for a set of specified tests.

New test:
=========
New tests can easily be added. Just create a new folder with a cfg and data file.
Add a new line to the end of the run-tests.pl file.
Remember to enter an indicative string you expect to occurr in the log file.

First run:
==========
If a test runs for the first time with single-pf-test.pl, a reference analysis will 
be created in the analysis_ref folder if the indicative string is found in the log file.
Even if the PF run encounters an error things are ok as long as the indicative
string is found.

Successive runs:
================
In successive runs, single-pf-test.pl will do the following:
If the run should complete without error messages, it will compare the
best_schemes.txt files as welll as the all_schemes.txt files of the reference analyis and the
new analysis.

If the run is expected to produce an error message, it will still pass if the indicative
sting is found in the log file. In this case we do not compare any results except the
indicative string.

When running, run-tests.pl will mention the test which have failed or passed and
it will print a summary of the number of tests fail, passed, etc.
