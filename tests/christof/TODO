Done:
Parsing the cfg file. (Models, Block coordinates, syntax errors)
Parsing the sequence file (Sequence names, etc.)

TODO:

1. Do we parse out the correct information from the output files
2. Does the -f B option work as expected (i.e. when branch lengths are 'linked' do the RAxML tree files really have all the same relative branch lengths).
3. When branch lengths are unlinked, do the RAxML tree files all have independent branch lengths?
4. Do we calculate the number of parameters correctly for each subset and each model?
5. Do we calculate AIC, AICc, and BIC scores correctly?
6. Testing search=user.
7. Testing wheights.
8. More data sets raxml versus phyml
9. Odd data sets
10. Clustering
