Bugs to Fix
-----------

- If I run an analysis with all models, then subsequently run an analysis with
  a limited list of models (e.g. just 'JC') then the second analysis uses all
  models, instead of the limted list. This seems to be a bug that was
  introduced when we switched to saving binaries - Brett, can you have a go at
  fixing this (subsets.py presumably) - I'm not sure how this would work, but
  it's important for the analyses we want to do for the first paper.
	
- PhyML writer in aligment.py was wrong (truncated names to 10 characters)
  this gives a silly error - when names get truncated the alignment
  (incorrectly) gets flagged as different we need two fixes here:
    1. Fix the alignment.py file so that it write up to 100 characters (what
       PhyML can take)
    - fixed by Rob
    2. Fix the alignment comparison function so that it compares a truncated
       alignment with a truncated alignment (e.g. if species names were >100
       characters long)
	
- Scheme output files
    - Rob made some changes in scheme.py, these are fine I think, but a bit
      clunky. Brett might want to make them pretty...
	
- Found an instance where I can fuck with the config file, and it's not picked
  up when I re-run the analysis (i.e. no message like "you changed the config
  file, I'm going to start again")
    - I can give myself whacky results because of this.
    - It happens when I change the name of the partitions around under
      [partitions]
    - All I did was swap two of the names, but the program doesn't spot it,
      and so presumably ends up with bogus results
	
- If I kill an analysis at the stage where it's building an initial tree, then
  re-run it, it fails.  Should be easy to fix by checking the initial tree
  output files, and just deleting everythign and starting over if it doesn't
  look right

- Can we add a 'flush' option to log.info, so in some loops at various points
  (e.g. creating schemes, doing long lists of models for a given subset) we
  can print output about progress, and flush it at each iteration of the loop.
  Or maybe we should just have a log.flush which does this. It will often be
  useful to convince people (including me) that stuff is happenening, and that
  the program hasn't just hung. 

- I get an error when I run PF without anything in the 'user schemes' section
    - I think this is now fixed.


Bugs already Fixed
------------------

- If I quit an analysis half way through and restart, things happen but it's 
  not all good.  it looks to me like the 'scheme' names start from '1' again 
  on the second time around.  they should start wherever the last analysis
  left off right?
   
- Alignments should be allowed to have underscores (and other shit) in the
  names. I ran into trouble with an alignment which had underscores and
  wouldn't load until I replaced them with other shit.
    - now fixed by Brett-.
	
- The phylip parser is kind of horrible. I get all sorts of errors all over
  the place, Brett and I will have to go through this. In general, we should
  follow the PhyML guidelines for formatting, (pasted below) which will let us
  catch format errors ourselves before we ask phyml to do any analysis
    - also fixed by Brett

- When I re-run a previously completed run, it is a bit slower than I would
  expect, and I'm not sure why...  which files is it getting the info on
  subsets from? If its the subset files (which it should be if we're planning
  to later delete all the PhyML output) I would have expected it to be a bit
  quicker.  If it's getting it from the PhyML output files (/phyml) then maybe
  it's slow because each subset involves opening up and finding info from 56
  separate files.  I think this is confirmed because reducing the number of
  models speeds up things a lot.
   - fixed by Brett
   
- Alignment.py had a missing comma before max=100
