Bugs
----

1. I get an error when I run PF without anything in the 'user schemes' section
    - I think this is now fixed.

2. If I quit an analysis half way through and restart, things happen but it's
   not all good.  it looks to me like the 'scheme' names start from '1' again
   on the second time around.  they should start wherever the last analysis
   left off right?
   
3. Alignments should be allowed to have underscores (and other shit) in the
   names. I ran into trouble with an alignment which had underscores and
   wouldn't load until I replaced them with other shit.

4. When I re-run a previously completed run, it is a bit slower than I would
   expect, and I'm not sure why...  which files is it getting the info on
   subsets from? If its the subset files (which it should be if we're planning
   to later delete all the PhyML output) I would have expected it to be a bit
   quicker.  If it's getting it from the PhyML output files (/phyml) then
   maybe it's slow because each subset involves opening up and finding info
   from 56 separate files.  I think this is confirmed because reducing the
   number of models speeds up things a lot.
