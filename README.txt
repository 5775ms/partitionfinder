# Partition Finder

PartitionFinder is a Python program for simultaneously choosing partitioning
schemes and models of molecular evolution for DNA sequence data. It is useful
to use before running a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequence data, in order
to decide how to divide up your sequence data into separate blocks before
analysis, and to simultaneously perform model selection on each of those
blocks.
