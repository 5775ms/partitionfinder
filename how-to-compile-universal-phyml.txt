Instructions for making a mac universal binary for PhyML

Here are the architectures that work:
-arch x86_64 
-arch ppc 
-arch i386

For each architecture, edit the following line in configure.ac

CFLAGS="-O3 -m32 -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -Wall ${ARCH_flag}"

by replacing "${ARCH_flag}" with e.g. "-arch x_86_64", e.g.:

CFLAGS="-O3 -m32 -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -Wall -arch x_86_64"

Then go into the /src folder, and rename the phyml binary appropriately (e.g. Phyml_x86_64)

Do this for all three architectures.

Compile into a universal binary using lipo, as follows:

lipo [file1] [file2] [file3] -create -output phyml

where file1 is the path to one of the binaries. 

This makes a universal binary that should work on all three architectures.
