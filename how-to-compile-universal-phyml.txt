Instructions for making a mac universal binary for PhyML

Here are the architectures that work:
-arch x86_64 
-arch ppc 
-arch i386

For each architecture, edit the following line in configure.ac

ARCH_flag="-arch x86_64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.4"

by replacing "x86_64" with each of the three architectures in turn

After each one, run ./confphy, and then go into /src and rename the phyml binary appropriately (e.g. Phyml_x86_64)

Do this for all three architectures.

Compile into a universal binary using lipo, as follows:

lipo [file1] [file2] [file3] -create -output phyml

where file1 is the path to one of the binaries. 

This makes a universal binary that should work on all three architectures.
