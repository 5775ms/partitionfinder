Before initial release (in order of priority)
---------------------------------------------
- check that Brett's implementation of source alignment and filtered alignment works.
- flag a warning if ANYTHING in the .cfg file has changed. Do this by putting a copy of the .cfg file in the 'analysis' folder, loading it and comparing it to the current one
- quit without running if 'branch_lengths' has changed. There will be results, but they won't be what people thought.
- Get better .cfg parsing, so that we get useful error messages
- Don't save phyml by default, there is way too many of them, but keep a commandline option to do so
- Only parse user schemes if 'search' == 'user' (Rob tried and failed to figure this out
- Use all CPU's default (rather than 1)
- Maybe have mrbayes spec in the config file (for model defs)
- add a more efficient Bell-number counter when counting schemes
- maybe? avoid generating all schemes at start, generate and analyse on the fly instead. That big recursion takes up a lot of time when it gets really really deep. (probably forget this one for now though).


Done
____
- build initial tree and branchlengths NOT from the source alignment, but from the un-partitioned alignment. These can be different e.g. if I exclude some sites from all of my partitions. This is really important.
- Ordered scheme output in partitions in codon order (in scheme.py.write_summary)
- implemented Greedy search algorithm. Right now it works on whatever metric you specify in model_selection
- tidied up output of all_schemes.txt, best_schemes.txt, and the subset output files too
- Added model_selection option, AIC, AICc, or BIC now implemented
- Added branch_lengths option 'linked' or 'unlinked'
- Fixed calling of PhyML so that it actually constrains brlens
- PhyML constrained_lens option fixed by Stephane
- Added an error message if you specify a partition with sites that aren't in the alignment
- Fixed partition definition to include single sites
- optional charset at beginning of partition def
