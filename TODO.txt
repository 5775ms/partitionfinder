Before initial release
----------------------

- Delete data and restart as default (with warning message)
- Don't save phyml by default, there is way too many of them
- Use all CPU's default (rather than 1)
- Maybe have mrbayes spec in the config file (for model defs)
- optional charset at beginning of partition def. Done? 
- Order scheme output in partition codon order (in scheme.py.write_summary)
- Linking or unlinked branch lengths (change parser and model_commandline)
