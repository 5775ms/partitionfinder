Dear all,
We're pleased to announce the release of PartitionFinder v1.1.0. 
PartitionFinder is a program that allows for the combined selection
of partitioning schemes and models of molecular evolution for DNA
and amino acid datasets. 

It is available here: 

www.robertlanfear.com/partitionfinder

Version 1.1.0 includes a number of major improvements:

    * Support for very large datasets (100s of genes, 1000s of taxa)
    * New, faster, algorithms for finding partitioning schemes
    * Support for model selection using RAxML
    * Output of the best partitioning scheme in RAxML format
    
We are actively working on the program, so please do get in touch if 
you have questions, suggestions, or comments. Many of the 
improvements in this version came from user suggestions, so we hope 
that others will find them useful too.

Yours,

Rob Lanfear
